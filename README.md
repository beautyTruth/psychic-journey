# Code Alongs With Kylie Ying

I found a video on [freeCodeCamp.org][def] where an obviously very smart human named [Kylie Ying][def2] invites we, the viewer, to code along with her through [12 Python Projects][def3]. I'm starting this at just after 7 p.m. on Wednesday, August 09, 2023. I've walked in the sun, had lunch and dinner, and I coded along with Tech With Tim earlier in the day, so we'll see how long I can last with this before my brain needs a break. <br>

That was really fun, and Kylie explained three different ways one could concatenate strings to produce a madlib. We worked with f-string literals to produce this one. <br>

I'll be back to work more on this video later, as I've just been granted access to the IBM data science course I was accepted to last month. Kylie seems to be a natural teacher, so I'm excited to keep learning from her. She injects some quirky humor into the lessons, too, which makes things more fun.

I'm back at it on August 10, 2023, starting at about 8:10 p.m., coding along with Kylie. She just guided us through a number guessing program. <br>

And at 8:54, I'm finished coding along to complete a number guessing game where I pick a number and the computer narrows it down until it guesses correctly. These two number guessing games furter cured a few key concepts for me. <br>

At 9:19 with 1:07 hours of coding along with Kylie, I've just finished the rock, paper, scissors game. That was project 4 of 12 and we're only 00:24 through 03:00 hours of video. So I think the projects are going to increase in complexity. <br>

Back at it at 11:11 on Friday, August 11, 2023. Gonna code along with Kylie for as long as my brain cooperates.
