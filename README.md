# Code Alongs With Kylie Ying

I found a video on [freeCodeCamp.org][def] where an obviously very smart human named [Kylie Ying][def2] invites we, the viewer, to code along with her through [12 Python Projects][def3]. I'm starting this at just after 7 p.m. on Wednesday, August 09, 2023. I've walked in the sun, had lunch and dinner, and I coded along with Tech With Tim earlier in the day, so we'll see how long I can last with this before my brain needs a break. <br>

That was really fun, and Kylie explained three different ways one could concatenate strings to produce a madlib. We worked with f-string literals to produce this one. <br>

I'll be back to work more on this video later, as I've just been granted access to the IBM data science course I was accepted to last month. Kylie seems to be a natural teacher, so I'm excited to keep learning from her. She injects some quirky humor into the lessons, too, which makes things more fun.

I'm back at it on August 10, 2023, starting at about 8:10 p.m., coding along with Kylie. She just guided us through a number guessing program. <br>

And at 8:54, I'm finished coding along to complete a number guessing game where I pick a number and the computer narrows it down until it guesses correctly. These two number guessing games furter cured a few key concepts for me. <br>

At 9:19 with 1:07 hours of coding along with Kylie, I've just finished the rock, paper, scissors game. That was project 4 of 12 and we're only 00:24 through 03:00 hours of video. So I think the projects are going to increase in complexity. <br>

Back at it at 11:11 on Friday, August 11, 2023. Gonna code along with Kylie for as long as my brain cooperates. <br>

I left at about noon to get a haircut and a beard trim. Now I'm back at just after 6 p.m. to continue with hangman. <br>

I just finished hangman at 6:32 p.m. without having to stop for anything yet. I have conquered briefly what appear to be ADD symptoms every time I sit down to code. Like, why do I always feel the need to go do something else? "I think I'll go get a haircut and a beard trim." "I think I'll make some coffee." "I think I'll vacuum the carpet." <br>

Along with my vow to not watch football in my apartment this season, I am hereby making a vow to not check twitter or any social media once I have made a point to sit down to learn. Additionally, I now vow to not do anything unnecessary while I am proceeding with a predetermined learning time like now! <br>

Now I'm going to code along with Kylie on a version of the Tic Tac Toe game. We are now 36 minutes through the 3 hour video. This will be the sixth of 12 projects. Each of the next se7en projects should take an average of 20 minutes of the video. It is now 6:42. After the above declarations of attention span chastity, I feel hungry, so I'm going to go make a smoothie.<br>

Woah! Now exactly 1:00 hours through that 3:00-hour video and it is 8:52 p.m. Kylie took us through a whole bunch of stuff and mixed in a few concepts and clever indexing tricks that I didn't know existed. She even deliberately left some debugging in there so we could see her thought process with that. I was able to follow along and was surprised to have arrived at the same result she did. However, i was way out of my league on this one, kind of hanging on in terms of understanding things -- it took a lot of reading and rereading the code to understand what I was doing. My poor little brain performed well, though! Next up is an "unbeatable tic tac toe AI" project that I will leave for tomorrow's codealongocalypse. <br>

Saturday, August 12, 2023 is a planned off day. I completed a section of my IBM data analyst course that was due on August 20, 2023. <br>
