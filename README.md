# Code Alongs With Kylie Ying

I found a video on [freeCodeCamp.org][def] where an obviously very smart human named [Kylie Ying][def2] invites we, the viewer, to code along with her through [12 Python Projects][def3]. I'm starting this at just after 7 p.m. on Wednesday, August 09, 2023. I've walked in the sun, had lunch and dinner, and I coded along with Tech With Tim earlier in the day, so we'll see how long I can last with this before my brain needs a break. <br>
